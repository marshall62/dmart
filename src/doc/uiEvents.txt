Events

Image Slide Show Component:
   properties:
       artworks: array of artwork objects
       index: currently selected artwork in the carousel
       modalOpen: flag

  HTML:  Includes the image-focus, the image-carousel, and image-modal
  When a thumbnail is clicked in the carousel, it outputs an event that tells the focus component which
  image to show.  When the focus image is clicked, it navigates to a URL route for an image-modal that shows a large version
  of the artwork which is passed as state along with the index in the artworks list.

Image Carousel
manages a list of artworks displayed as a set of thumbnails with arrows to go left or right into the list.  Clicking a thumbnail
emits an event so that the image focus component will show that artwork above in the center.

Image focus

properties:
   artwork: the artwork object that is selected within the carousel

If the focus image is clicked, it navigates to a URL that is an image modal component that takes over the whole browser.
It does this so that the URL can be bookmarked.  The trick with this was getting the X button in the modal to return to the
place the user was on.  There are two scenarios: 1.  User was in the app on a image-carousel and clicked the focus image 2) User
came to the website from a URL to a specific image.   In 1, the router state includes the lastURL the user was on and the
index of the image that was selected.  On closing the modal we can then navigate back to this URL and set the index so that it sets the focus image
correctly (it doesn't correctly scroll the carousel to where it would need to be for a thumbnail that's not on screen but
thats a minor issue). In 2, closing the modal navigates to the home page "" route.
