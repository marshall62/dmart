TODO:

Create an "archived" folder in github for images that are older.  Make the app work so that I don't have to create a Mongo record
for these.  The backend should have an endpoint like /artworks/archived  that generates a list of Artworks objects from all the
images in this directory.  The front-end should have a new menu item "archived" which displays these.

Need some form of sorting or grouping images.  To wit, there's a lot of still life paintings.  If I want to group together all
the chestnut ones could I have a group="chestnuts" or group="3" and put this on all of them.  My lookups would then need to sort
on these group fields (perhaps as a secondary field behind date)

Might want some way to break out categories based on date.  Not sure how this should work from UX but there are just far too many
things when you get outside the RecentWork category.  

Adjust CSS for colors of background and text based on the config object.

There are apps that ping the heroku apps to keep them alive and from being swapped out (e.g. Kaffeine )  [https://medium.com/@morgannewman/how-to-keep-your-free-heroku-app-online-forever-4093ef69d7f5 ]
